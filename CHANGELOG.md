# Changelog

Newest build first. This file ships next to Optima.exe and is rendered by the UPDATE LOG
page in the app, so keep the format: one `## date - title` heading per build, `-` bullets
under it, plain text, no em dashes.

## 2026-08-28 - Custom refresh rate fix and a real driver uninstall

- Custom mode fix: applying a custom mode (for example 1920x1080 @ 240 Hz) no longer
  lands on the driver's 999 Hz placeholder. Optima now checks what the driver actually
  advertises to Windows instead of trusting vdd_settings.xml, reloads the driver and
  waits until the mode really appears, then verifies the display settled at the
  requested mode and re-applies once if the driver reverted it. If the mode still does
  not stick, the app reports the actual mode instead of claiming success.
- Placeholder rates (999/9999 Hz) are filtered out of every mode list; valid refresh
  rates are capped at 500 Hz.
- Uninstall driver: the button on the Display page now asks for confirmation and
  performs a complete uninstall, removing both the device and the staged driver
  package from the Windows DriverStore behind one administrator prompt. The install
  banner returns afterwards so the driver can be reinstalled any time.
- The project source now lives on GitHub (private repository), with the built
  Optima.exe attached to each release.

## 2026-08-27 - Overlay, sessions, network, watch mode, guided benchmark

- FPS overlay: Alt+F10 (or automatic during sessions when enabled in Settings) shows a
  click-through, never-activating FPS/frametime readout over the borderless game, with
  configurable corner and opacity and an optional network line.
- FPS capture fix: the ETW trace no longer assumes the emulator process presents the
  frames; every game-related process is a candidate and the trace locks onto whichever
  one actually presents. A probe on the DEVELOPER page lists presenting processes when
  capture stays silent.
- SESSIONS page (Alt+0): trends over recent sessions as sparklines, full history with
  launch kind, network quality and config-change markers, and a per-session drill-down
  of the stored per-second FPS series. Session rows now record enabled tweak ids and a
  profile content hash; the database migrates automatically with a backup.
- Network quality: passive ping / jitter / loss during sessions, preferring the game's
  own endpoints and falling back to a reference host with an explicit label. Live on the
  SYSTEM page, stored per session.
- Watch mode (off by default): starting the game outside Optima applies the full
  selected profile and restores everything when the game exits. Never double-applies
  with PLAY and never triggers a surprise UAC prompt. Toggle in Settings or the tray.
- Guided benchmark on the SESSIONS page: A vs B over N alternating runs, drift-aborted
  when tweaks or profiles change mid-plan, with a per-run Welch verdict ahead of the
  pooled view.
- publish.ps1: one command refreshes publish\Optima.exe (stops running instances,
  cleans stale files, publishes the helper and the app in the right order).

## 2026-08-26 - Bundled driver install and the Optima rename

- The virtual display driver package travels inside the build and installs from the
  Display page: one administrator prompt, no Device Manager.
- The Display page no longer shows an install button when there is nothing to install.
- Project renamed to Optima; black monochrome terminal redesign of the whole UI;
  em dashes removed from source, UI text and docs.

## 2026-08-25 - Initial release

- Full initial implementation: detection, launch strategies, performance profiles,
  virtual display control, monitoring, benchmark mode, crash recovery, diagnostics and
  the elevated helper.
